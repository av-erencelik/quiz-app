# Quiz Trivia

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description 

After finishing Shopping project with using react-router-dom,I decided to learn about useContext hook and react-redux library for state management. While learning these topics also started to learn how to make https request and fetching data, API calls on react-projects. First I learned the useContext API and created this project with useContext. After creating working gh-page I decided to change useContext state management to react-redux store and created with redux state management again. This is the fourth project that I ever created with ReactJS. I am happy that I was able to finish project successfully.
